What is Segmented Control Buttons you might ask, it’s actually a native iOS UIView. Basically, you are able to select an option just like a **RadioButton**.

Segmented Control Buttons is an intuitive way to simplify complex forms and provide a great user experience that allows **fluid user interactions**. Its flexibility allows the label to have a combination of both text or icons.

Besides that, it fully utilises the horizontal space with the use of having the RadioButton and its label occupying the same footprint. Plus, users can still remain in the same context space while filling form without having to click on a **Dropdown Menu** or a **Popup Menu** selection.

So, besides using the legacy input of a **Dropdown Menu** or a **Popup Menu** behaviour that was carried over from web design.

Let’s build your first **Segmented Control Buttons** to bring some fun back to form filling again!
